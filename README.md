# Model-Pruning
#A Deep Learning model optimization technique
. It improves computational speed of the model as well as reduces its size by affecting its accuarcy slightly.
I have used Tensorflow2.0 framework and kerassurgeon module for pruning
Kerassurgeon Github link: https://github.com/BenWhetton/keras-surgeon 
Keras-Surgeon is installed from PyPI using pip.

pip install kerassurgeon

Use this command.
